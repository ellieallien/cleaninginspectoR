\title{Rudimentary checks to flag potentially problematic values in a dataset}
\details{
Functionality

\code{inspect_all()}: applies all checks listed below
\code{find_duplicates()} looks for duplicates in columns that should be unique
\code{find_duplicates_uuid()} looks for a function containing "uuid" in the name and looks for duplicates
\code{find_outliers()} looks for outliers in numerical columns
\code{find_other_responses()} looks for values in potential "if other, specify.." type of columns

Output
The output has the same structure for all functions of this package:
A data frame with the following columns:
value	variable	has_issue	issue_type

\code{index}: the index of the row of the original data in which the issue occured.  (NA if applies to multiple rows)
\code{value} the suspicious value
\code{variable} The column containing the suspicious value
\code{has_issue} logical TRUE/FALSE: currently always true, can be ignored.
\code{issue_type} a description/name of the potential issue

Limitations
\enumerate{
\item These checks are under no circumstances sufficient or complete: more context and data specific checks are always necessary.
\item Any data protection related checks are \emph{rudimentary} at best and are under no circumstances sufficient to ensure data protection in any way
\item Although tempting, this package should \emph{never} be used to automatically remove any flagged values without double checking them manually. This would seriously skew your dataset, and make uncertainty estimates invalid. Potential issues must be investigated on a case by case basis.
